I have no/zero/nada/zilch experience with Python and GIS, so I am trying to learn as much as I can about anything that is presented. By the end of the course, I hope that I can at least pass for someone with a not embarassing level of understanding of such terms as "geospatial data" or "programming" or "computer".
Project ideas: I am interested in the effects that lithium speculation in Bolivia is affecting indigenous land claims in the southeastern part of the country (forming one of the three corners of South America's "Lithium Triangle"). I would be interested in exploring the politics of the land survey, conflicts over territorial sovereignty, and the affects that the international market for lithium is having on Bolivia's politics of land use. 
I am also interested in exposure to environmental toxins, particularly those created by petroleum refining in the United States. I would be interested in a project that relates regional demographics, average household income, workers' protections and healthcare access, with proximity to petroleum refineries and incidence of diseases related to prolonged exposure to toxins associated with petroleum refining.
